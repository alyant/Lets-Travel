2,”Mont Saint-Michel”,”France”,48.6361,1.5115,"Its safe to say there’s nothing in the world quite like this magical island, topped by a medieval monastery that rises out of the bay like a heavenly apparition. It’s said that, early in the 8th century, a bishop in nearby Avranches was visited by the archangel Michael, who told him to build a church atop an island out to sea. From 966 onward, the dukes of Normandy, supported by French kings, oversaw the development of a major Benedictine abbey on Mont St-Michel. Massive buildings were added throughout the Medieval period, and the abbey became a renowned center of learning, attracting some of the greatest minds in Europe. The picturesque island rises majestically from the sea during high tide and is accessible to the mainland during low tide. ","Rennes, France - 75km"
3,”Vienna”,”Austria”,48.2082,16.3738,"There are plenty of reasons to fall in love with Vienna: the majestic architecture; the imperial presence in the streets of the Innere Stadt (the First District); the music, literature, and art. Best of all, the city has a longstanding tradition of allowing music, opera, and philharmonic orchestra to remain available to everyone from students to royalty. Vienna is among Europe’s most walkable cities, and each district has its own distinct vibe. The ancient paths of the First District give way to the Donaukanal—the branch of the Danube that runs through the city. Take a tram around the Ringstrasse, which circles the inner city, to see the breadth of the architecture or stop at an iconic café for a coffee and a strudel. Across the river, you’ll find the newly vibrant Second District, Leopoldstadt. ","Vienna, Austria - 18km"

The diversity means it’s hard to pin down Berlin’s ambience precisely: it’s whatever you want it to be. When you visit Berlin, reminders of the city’s fragile history—like the Berlin Wall and Berlin Palace—will surround you. Such historical attractions mingle with today’s many nightclubs, which have made Berlin one of Europe’s most exciting destinations for young adults who travel to Berlin to experience the booming techno scene. Still, the city offers plenty of outdoor attractions like the Tiergarten and Viktoriapark, and an impressive collection of cutting-edge museums and galleries.

In downtown Napa, 19th-century architecture and Queen Anne mansions still populate the riverfront, though new hotels, tasting rooms, and restaurants are transforming the town into a cool, walkable hub. On the southern end of the valley, Carneros shows off the county’s rustic roots with boutique wineries and elegantly understated hotels modeled after farmhouses. Central Napa is as chic as ever, with Michelin-starred restaurants and winery design inspired by French châteaux constantly one-upping one another.

Check out the views from the top of the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, or One World Observatory. Take yourself on a museum crawl, starting at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on the northeastern edge of Central Park. Then, make your way north several blocks to the Guggenheim Museum and eventually to the Museum of the City of New York, one of the best places to learn about the Big Apples history.

The oldest national park in Canada has a majestic beauty and offers a playground of outdoor sports options—from hiking to skiing to fishing and more. It has walkable streets, a wide range of restaurants, and no shortage of fudge shops. The town started, ostensibly, in 1888 when the Canadian Pacific Railway built the grande dame Banff Springs Hotel, in order to get more people to visit Banff National Park.

Located on a mountain ridge at an elevation of 2.430 m above sea level, Machu Picchu is built in the typical “ashlar” technique of the Incas, in which huge blocks of stone are cut regularly to fit together without mortar. The Incas were masters of this technique; Machu Picchu shows us that they were also skilled in the construction of terraced fields and aqueducts.

Awesome in the spring with its famous masses of cherry blossom, the fiery red colors of fall are equally resplendent in Kyoto.
